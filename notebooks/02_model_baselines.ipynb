    "### Author: Michelle Lynn George (Elle)  \n",
    "### Institution: Vanderbilt University, School of Engineering  \n",

    "### Version: 1.0  \n",

    "## Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    ">This notebook builds **baseline models** using the cleaned PHQ-8 labels from [01_import_clean_eda.ipynb](./01_import_clean_eda.ipynb). \n",
    "By establishing clear baselines, we can measure how much value is added later by richer multimodal features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- **Load cleaned labels** (`data/cleaned/labels_clean.parquet`). \n",
    "- **Define features/target** PHQ-8 item-level responses `phq8_binary`. \n",
    "- **Split data** using stratified train/test. \n",
    "- **Train & evaluate baselines:** \n",
    " - Dummy Classifier (majority baseline). \n",
    " - Logistic Regression (interpretable linear model). \n",
    "- **Evaluate performance** with ROC/PR curves, confusion matrix, and average precision. \n",
    "- **Interpret coefficients** to see which PHQ-8 items drive predictions. \n",
    "- **Interactive what-if analysis**: adjust item scores with sliders to explore model sensitivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "A transparent, interpretable baseline provides the benchmark for all future modeling. \n",
    "It helps confirm label balance, highlights the impact of class imbalance, and gives stakeholders an intuitive way to understand the model before moving into multimodal fusion.\n",

    "**🔵 Logistic Regression (impute + scale)**  \n",
    "- Purpose: simple but interpretable linear model  \n",
    "- Results: ROC AUC = 1.0, AP = 1.0 on this dataset  \n",
    "- Coefficients: strongest predictors included **appetite**, **sleep disturbance**, and **tiredness**  \n",
    "- Significance: demonstrates **excellent discriminative ability** while remaining fully interpretable  \n",
