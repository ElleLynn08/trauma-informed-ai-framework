# Recognizing the Unseen: A Multimodal, Trauma-Informed AI Framework for Crisis Detection and Clinical Assessment

> Graduate independent study exploring interpretable AI for trauma-aware emotional state recognition and clinical augmentation.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

This research explores a trauma-informed, multimodal AI framework that detects affective patterns such as emotional shutdown, dissociation, or depressive flat affect in high-stakes environments. The goal is to support—not replace—human decision-making in clinical and crisis response contexts.

This first phase leverages the **DAIC-WOZ dataset** to prototype an emotionally-aware, ethically guided ML system with a strong emphasis on transparency and real-world clinical relevance.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Traditional AI systems often misinterpret trauma responses—mistaking withdrawal, flat affect, or dissociation for resistance or noncompliance. This work contributes to the growing movement toward **compassion-centered**, **bias-mitigated**, and **interpretable** machine learning solutions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.12
- OpenFace, OpenSMILE for facial and audio features
- HuggingFace Transformers (BERT / DistilBERT)
- SHAP or LIME for explainability
